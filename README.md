Hello, my name is Automated on the l# forums. This summer I have decided to learn how to code assemblies and this github will contain my attempts. Appreciate all the great examples on the forums as it makes learning much easier. If you notice that I forgot to give credits to anybody please let me know and ill make the necessary changes. 
 
AutomatedAmumu - Credits to iMeh and Beaving. Using Imeh's Twitch# assembly as a template as well as using his damage drawing class. Beaving has a lot of great assemblies as well which helped me quite a bit.  

AutomatedEvelynn - Credits to Imeh and blackt34. Using imehs damage drawing class,  and learned how to use/cast smite thanks to blackt34's code. 

LoadingFreezeCheck - Credit to Nouser as this assembly is merely a personalized version of his assembly.
